# mkcolor

*an experiment in randomized vim color schemes*

This project was inspired by the [random color contrasts][] Mastodon bot. I wanted to take the idea
of picking colors and measuring their color contrast, and scale it up to picking many different
colors and using them to create a somewhat-coherent text editor color scheme.

An eventual goal for this is to create an exporter that will create a valid Vim color scheme file
that you could add to your configuration. (A far-future goal might include getting this
randomization into a Vim plugin, but i don't want to get too far ahead of myself...)

The project is hosted at <https://quietmisdreavus.github.io/mkcolor/> using the master branch.
